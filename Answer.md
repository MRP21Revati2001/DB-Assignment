Q 1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

In the provided schema, the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is established through a foreign key in the "Product" table.
Specifically, the "Product" table contains a column named "category_id" that serves as a foreign key referencing the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table.
Ans=>
Here's the relevant part of the "Product" table definition:
Table "product_category" {
  "id" int [pk]
  "name" varchar
  "desc" text
  "created_at" timestamp
  "modified_at" timestamp
  "deleted_at" timestamp
}

Here's the relevant part of the "Product" table definition:
Table "product" {
  "id" int [pk]
  "name" varchar
  "desc" text
  "SKU" varchar
  "category_id" int [ref: > product_category.id]
  "inventory_id" int [ref: > product_inventory.category_id]
  "price" decimal
  "discout_at" int [ref: > discount.discount_id]
  "created_at" timestamp
  "modified_at" timestamp
  "deleted_at" timestamp
}
The column "category_id" in the "Product" table is a foreign key that references the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables,
where each record in the "Product" table is associated with a specific category in the "Product_Category" table.

In terms of cardinality:

Product_Category: 1 (one category)
Product: Many (many products)
This relationship implies that each product belongs to one and only one category, while a category can have multiple associated products. This is a typical example of a one-to-many relationship.

Q2.How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Ans=>
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use a foreign key constraint. In the provided schema, this constraint is already in place through the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, which references the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table.

Here's a summary of the relevant part of the "Product" table definition:
Table "product" {
  "id" int [pk]
  "name" varchar
  "desc" text
  "SKU" varchar
  "category_id" int [ref: > product_category.id]
  "inventory_id" int [ref: > product_inventory.category_id]
  "price" decimal
  "discout_at" int [ref: > discount.discount_id]
  "created_at" timestamp
  "modified_at" timestamp
  "deleted_at" timestamp
}

In this definition, the "category_id" column is specified as a foreign key that references the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table. This means that the value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must match an existing value in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table.

Enforcing this foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity and guarantees that each product in the "Product" table is associated with a valid category in the "Product_Category" table. If an attempt is made to insert or update a record in the "Product" table with a non-existent or invalid "category_id," the database system will reject the operation, preventing the creation of orphaned records and maintaining the consistency of the data.
